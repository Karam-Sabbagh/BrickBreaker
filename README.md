# BrickBreaker
BrickBreaker is a game made with Python using tkinter. 
Your goal in this game is to break all of the bricks at the top of the window before the time left is over and not to let the ball go off the screen at the bottom of the screen.
You can move the paddle that's at the bottom of the window by pressing left or right arrows to not let the ball go off and for breaking the bricks.

For playing the game you can download the files and just launch the exe file,
you can also look into the game's code and how I made at the same folder that you've downloaded.
